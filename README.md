# Cod-ON-fest
Cod{ON}fest is a 45 days long coding fest, which will be divided into 2 phase - Phase 1 (Practice Phase) 30 days Phase 2 (Challenge Phase) 15 days.
Phase 1 will be a pure learning phase. The main focus will be to cover all the important data structures and algorithms.
I'm one of the mentees and this repo will contain all the assignments and activities I did as part of this program.
